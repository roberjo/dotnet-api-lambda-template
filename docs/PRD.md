A Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API template project designed for AWS Lambda, incorporating best practices, would include the following sections.

1. Introduction
This PRD outlines the requirements for a robust, secure, and performant ASP.NET Core 8 Web API template. The primary goal is to provide a foundational project that adheres to modern best practices and is optimized for deployment as an AWS Lambda function, triggered via Amazon API Gateway. This template will serve as a starting point for developers to build production-ready serverless applications quickly.

2. Target Audience
This template is intended for developers and teams using ASP.NET Core who need to build and deploy Web APIs on a serverless architecture, specifically AWS Lambda. Users should have a basic understanding of .NET, C#, and core AWS concepts (Lambda, API Gateway, IAM).

3. Functional Requirements
RESTful API: The project must provide a clear and organized structure for building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core's controller-based or Minimal API patterns.

AWS Lambda Compatibility: The project must be configured to run as an AWS Lambda function using the Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer NuGet package. This includes proper configuration for handling API Gateway proxy requests.

API Versioning: The API should support versioning to allow for non-breaking changes over time. Route-based versioning (e.g., /api/v1/resource) is the preferred method for simplicity and clear routing.

OAuth 2.0 Authentication: The API must support OAuth 2.0 with JWT Bearer tokens. It must be configurable to validate tokens from an external Identity Provider, such as AWS Cognito, Auth0, or Okta.

Authorization: The API should support role-based and policy-based authorization to control access to specific endpoints or resources.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1. Cybersecurity Hardening
HTTPS Only: The API Gateway configuration must enforce HTTPS.

Rate Limiting: The API should include built-in rate limiting to protect against abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

Input Validation: The template must demonstrate best practices for input validation using data annotations or a validation library like FluentValidation.

Security Headers: The project should be configured to send security-related HTTP headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).

Secrets Management: The template should use a secure mechanism for managing secrets, such as AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables, instead of hardcoding them in appsettings.json.

4.2. Performance
Cold Start Optimization: The template must be optimized for fast cold starts. This can be achieved using .NET's Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation and by using a lean project structure.

Asynchronous Programming: All I/O-bound operations (e.g., database access, external API calls) must be implemented asynchronously (async/await) to improve scalability.

Caching: The template should demonstrate how to implement caching, potentially using a distributed cache like AWS ElastiCache for Redis, to reduce redundant data fetching.

4.3. Observability and Logging
Structured Logging: The template must use a structured logging framework like Serilog to log data in a machine-readable format (JSON). Logs should be routed to AWS CloudWatch.

Request Correlation: A unique correlation ID must be generated for each request and propagated through all logs and downstream service calls to facilitate debugging.

Metrics and Tracing: The template should be configured for observability, using AWS's built-in tools like CloudWatch and X-Ray to monitor performance and trace requests.

Logging Delegates: The use of logging delegates or LogContext (in Serilog) should be demonstrated to enrich log entries with contextual information.

4.4. Code Quality and Maintainability
Clean Architecture: The project must be structured according to Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API). This promotes loose coupling and testability.

Dependency Injection: The template must make extensive use of ASP.NET Core's built-in Dependency Injection (DI) container.

Testing: The template must include dedicated projects and examples for unit tests (using xUnit and Moq) and integration tests to ensure code quality. The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing package should be used for integration testing.

5. Deployment
The template must include configuration files and instructions for deployment to AWS Lambda, including:

Serverless Framework: The project should include a serverless.yaml file for easy deployment using the Serverless Framework.

AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM): Alternatively, a template.yaml file for deployment with AWS SAM.

CI/CD Pipeline: The PRD should outline the recommended steps for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using services like AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.
