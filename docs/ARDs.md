# Architectural Decision Records (ARDs)

This document contains the architectural decisions made for the ASP.NET Core 8 Web API Lambda template project.

## ADR-001: Clean Architecture with CQRS and MediatR

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Context:** Need to establish a maintainable, testable architecture for the ASP.NET Core 8 Web API template.

**Decision:** Implement Clean Architecture with four layers and CQRS pattern using MediatR.

**Architecture Layers:**
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, application services, DTOs, interfaces, CQRS commands/queries
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access, external services, AWS integrations
- **API Layer**: Controllers, middleware, request/response models

**CQRS Implementation:**
- Use MediatR for command/query separation

- Queries for read operations (Get, List, Search)
- Event handlers for domain events

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Improved separation of concerns
- ✅ Enhanced testability
- ✅ Better scalability for read/write operations
- ❌ Increased complexity
- ❌ More boilerplate code

## ADR-005: In-Memory Caching with Cache-Aside Pattern

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Context:** Need to optimize Lambda performance and reduce cold start times.

**Decision:** Implement in-memory caching with cache-aside pattern and TTL invalidation.

**Caching Strategy:**
- In-memory caching (no distributed cache for simplicity)
- Cache-aside pattern with TTL invalidation
- No provisioned concurrency
- Target cold start time: <100ms
- Database connection pooling

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Fast cold start times
- ✅ Simple caching implementation
- ✅ Reduced database load
- ❌ Cache not shared between Lambda instances
- ❌ Memory limitations per instance

## ADR-006: Comprehensive Observability with Serilog and CloudWatch

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Context:** Need comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities for production.

**Decision:** Implement structured logging with Serilog, CloudWatch integration, and X-Ray tracing.

**Logging:**
- Serilog structured logging to CloudWatch
- Standard log levels with enrichment
- Request correlation IDs
- CloudWatch dashboards and alarms

**Monitoring:**
- Health check endpoints (/health, /ready, /live)
- Request tracing and correlation
- Global exception handling middleware
- Secure error responses (no implementation details leaked)
- AWS X-Ray tracing support

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Comprehensive observability
- ✅ Easy debugging and troubleshooting
- ✅ Production-ready monitoring
- ❌ Additional AWS costs
- ❌ Complex configuration
